# TO-DO-list
This project I've got as a first asigment. 
I used HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, jQuery and in this project local storage is used to store data.
In TO-DO list is posible to add items, edit them, delete them, add Timer (just working for miliseconds) and there is option to Delete All and start from empty list.
I added favicon :-)
